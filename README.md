# Github Release Popularity Prediction
### Authors: Yuting Cui, Man Zhang

This project predicts the stars achieved within one week of a Github release, based on 
the semantic details of the release and existing poplularity of both the repository and its author.
Trending topics are also factored into the prediction.
## Training models:
We have utilized 3 kind of model: Xgboost, GBM, random forest model to train on the dataset. For each predicition results, we have drawn Scattter plot, Residuals plot and Error Histogram for comparsion between acutual labels and prediction labels.
